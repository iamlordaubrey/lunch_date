## Welcome to Lunch date

Have a really large team and would love to promote team bonding?  
New faces everywhere?  
Just want to have fun?

**Lunch date** is a slack application that randomly pairs a number of people in a slack channel. These people can then take it up from there.

The ideal scenario is they go have lunch together (i.e bonding while lunching). However, the possibilities are endless.

This is a WIP.

### Prerequisites

For now: 
- You need to create a public channel called *luncheon* in your slack team / organization. The pairings would be amongst members of this channel.
- The pairings would be done at 12:00 WAT.

### Installation

1. Go to our [Installation page](https://lunchdate-bot.herokuapp.com/) and click the **Add to Slack** button
2. Sign in to your team
3. Authorize the app

## Lunch date Slack Application

Have a really large team and would love to promote team bonding?  
So many new faces.. new faces *EVERYWHERE*?  
Just want to have fun?

**Lunch date** is a slack application that randomly pairs a number of people in a slack channel. These people can then take it up from there.

The ideal scenario is members who have been paired go have lunch together (i.e bonding while lunching). However, the possibilities are endless.  
This is a WIP.


### Prerequisites

At the moment: 
- Pairings is in 3's.
- You need to create a public channel called *luncheon* in your slack team / organization. The pairings would be amongst members of this channel.
- The pairings would be done at 12:00 WAT.


### Installation

1. Go to our [Installation page](https://lunchdate-bot.herokuapp.com/) and click the **Add to Slack** button
2. Sign in to your team
3. Authorize the app


### To know
The application is currently hosted on Heroku. I'm making use of [Uptime robot](https://uptimerobot.com/) for application monitoring.
